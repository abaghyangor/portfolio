## Projects

### 1. UCSD SMASH Hackathon – Beetle-Based Climate ML Model (Winner at UCSD, 6th Nationally)
#### [Link to the Project](https://github.com/abaghyangor/UCSD-Smash-NSF?tab=readme-ov-file) <br>
- As part of UCSD’s SMASH initiative in collaboration with the NSF HDR National ML Challenge, developed a machine learning model to predict soil condition changes using beetle population data as ecological indicators of climate shifts.
- Led the modeling and feature engineering pipeline, integrating ecological datasets with supervised learning methods to capture nonlinear relationships between species distribution and environmental stress factors. Focused on cross-validation robustness, interpretability, and generalization across geographic regions.
- Our team won 1st place at the UCSD-level competition among ~200 participants and placed 6th nationally. The project highlights applied environmental machine learning, interdisciplinary collaboration between data science and climate research, and translating biological indicators into predictive climate analytics.


### 2. CUREBench – Multi-Agent Medical Reasoning System ( Active )
#### [Link to the Project](https://github.com/abaghyangor/CUREBench/tree/feautres/improvements) <br>

- As part of the CUREBench competition hosted by Harvard Medical School, developed a multi-agent system to tackle complex healthcare question answering. The system routes questions across specialized agents (e.g., Pharmacology, Treatment Planning, Diagnostics), each powered by GPT-4o or GPT-4o-mini with domain-specific prompting.
- The pipeline achieves strong performance on the validation benchmark (84.5% accuracy) by orchestrating agents through a planner, enforcing structured outputs, and handling both multiple-choice and open-ended reasoning. Placed Top 25% of participants.
- Implemented strategies such as domain-specific prompts, dynamic routing, and error-driven refinement to ensure robustness on descriptive, edge-case clinical scenarios. The project highlights advanced LLM orchestration for medical QA, balancing cost-efficiency with high accuracy.

### 3. PokeAgent – Reinforcement Learning Speedrun Track (NeurIPS 2025)
#### [Link to the Project](https://github.com/abaghyangor/pokeagent-speedrun/tree/main) <br>
- As part of the NeurIPS 2025 PokeAgent Challenge (Speedrun Track), developed and optimized a reinforcement learning agent for strategic decision-making in a multi-agent Pokémon battle environment. The task required building an autonomous agent capable of reasoning under partial observability, stochastic transitions, and adversarial dynamics.
- Implemented policy optimization techniques, reward shaping, and environment-specific state encoding to improve sample efficiency and generalization across matchups. Focused on minimizing inference latency while preserving strategic depth, balancing exploration and exploitation under strict runtime constraints.
- Through iterative experimentation, hyperparameter tuning, and failure-case analysis, achieved a Top 10 overall placement globally. The project demonstrates applied reinforcement learning, multi-agent reasoning, and robust system optimization under competitive evaluation settings.


### 4. TweetLike - Who Said That?
#### [Link to the Project](https://github.com/abaghyangor/ripgor) <br>
- As part of a hackathon, developed TweetLike with my team, an interactive, quiz-style web application where users write their own tweet and guess which celebrity they sound like.
- The app features an engaging X (Twitter)-style interface that hides names and avatars until after prediction, creating a fun game experience.
- Used TF-IDF vectorization to convert tweets into numerical features and trained a Logistic Regression model to classify the text among multiple celebrities. The app also explains its predictions with simple and detailed breakdowns of keywords contributing to each guess.
