## Projects

### 1. Airbnb Listing Analysis in Paris
#### [Link to the project](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abaghyangor/airbnb-paris) <br>
This project involved analyzing a large Airbnb dataset to uncover trends in pricing and occupancy rates. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I cleaned and processed over 10,000 data entries to identify the factors driving booking demand. Through detailed data visualizations, I provided actionable insights that could help optimize pricing strategies for property hosts. This project demonstrated my ability to work with complex datasets and generate meaningful insights for real-world applications.


### 2. Interactive CRM Sales Dashboard

For this project, I developed a dynamic and fully automated sales dashboard using Google Sheets. The dashboard was designed to track customer interactions, sales performance, and other key business metrics in real time. By employing advanced formulas and conditional formatting, I created a tool that streamlined reporting and improved decision-making for sales teams. This project highlighted my proficiency in creating user-friendly data visualization tools tailored to business needs.

### 3. Fake News Detection

In this ongoing project, I am developing a machine learning model to detect and classify fake news using a labeled dataset. The process involves preprocessing textual data, extracting key features using techniques like TF-IDF, and training classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines. This project allows me to apply advanced natural language processing techniques and refine my understanding of how machine learning can address real-world societal challenges.
