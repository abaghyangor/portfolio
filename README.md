- Engaged with the data science community through discussions, comments, and dataset documentation
- Reached over 15,000+ views and 2,000+ downloads, with active use across multiple public notebooks

## Projects

### 1. JPMorgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research Virtual Experience Program on Forage - August 2025
#### [Link to the Project](https://forage-uploads-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/completion-certificates/Sj7temL583QAYpHXD/bWqaecPDbYAwSDqJy_Sj7temL583QAYpHXD_mhCY7RRkuevZHkP4u_1755442169342_completion_certificate.pdf) <br>
- Completed a simulation focused on quantitative research methods 
- Analyzed a book of loans to estimate a customer's probability of default
- Used dynamic programming to convert FICO scores into categorical data to predict defaults


### 2. Interactive CRM Sales Dashboard
#### [Link to the Dasbhoard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CBoRVgpnTeBB8h5gxVzkNOoIWWElK_bQFLD_fe2R8N4/edit?usp=sharing) <br> 
- Developed a dynamic and fully automated sales dashboard using Google Sheets.
- The dashboard was designed to track customer interactions, sales performance, and other key business metrics in real time.
- Employed advanced formulas and conditional formatting, created a tool that streamlined reporting and improved decision-making for sales teams. 

### 3. Fake News Detection
#### [Link to the Project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abaghyangor/fake-news) <br>
- Developed a machine learning model to detect and classify fake news based on textual analysis.
- Using TF-IDF vectorization, transformed article content into numerical representations and trained multiple classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Evaluated performance with precision, recall, and F1-score, identified the most effective model for distinguishing real from fake news.


### 4. TweetLike - Who Said That?
#### [Link to the Project](https://github.com/abaghyangor/ripgor) <br>
- As part of a hackathon, developed TweetLike with my team, an interactive, quiz-style web application where users write their own tweet and guess which celebrity they sound like.
- The app features an engaging X (Twitter)-style interface that hides names and avatars until after prediction, creating a fun game experience.
- Used TF-IDF vectorization to convert tweets into numerical features and trained a Logistic Regression model to classify the text among multiple celebrities. The app also explains its predictions with simple and detailed breakdowns of keywords contributing to each guess.
